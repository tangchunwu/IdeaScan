# Global Agent Rules

## 1. Environment & Shell Compatibility
- **OS**: Windows (PowerShell context).
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT use `&&` or `||` command chaining operators. These are not supported in standard Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **Protocol**:
  - Execute commands sequentially using separate `run_command` calls.
  - If chaining is absolutely necessary, use `;` (semicolon), but be aware it ignores errors.
  - PREFER separate tool calls to handle errors gracefully.

## 2. Language & Communication
- **Language**: Chinese (Simplified) for all interactions, thoughts, and documentation (except strict code/technical terms).
- **Style**: Concise, First Principles, Fact-based.

## 3. Workflow
- **Development**: Planning -> Review -> Execution -> Verification.
- **Tools**: Always update `task.md` and `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` to reflect progress.
